	abstract = {Robot control is a key competence for robot manufacturers and a lot of development is made to increase robot performance, reduce robot cost and introduce new functionalities. Examples of development areas that get big attention today are multi robot control, safe control, force control, 3D vision, remote robot supervision and wireless communication. The application benefits from these developments are discussed as well as the technical challenges that the robot manufacturers meet. Model-based control is now a key technology for the control of industrial robots and models and control schemes are continuously refined to meet the requirements on higher performance even when the cost pressure leads to the design of robot mechanics that is more difficult to control. Driving forces for the future development of robots can be found in, for example, new robot applications in the automotive industry, especially for the final assembly, in small and medium size enterprises, in foundries, in food industry and in the processing and assembly of large structures. Some scenarios on future robot control development are proposed. One scenario is that light-weight robot concepts could have an impact on future car manufacturing and on future automation of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). Such a development could result in modular robots and in control schemes using sensors in the robot arm structure, sensors that could also be used for the implementation of redundant safe control. Introducing highly modular robots will increase the need of robot installation support, making Plug and Play functionality even more important. One possibility to obtain a highly modular robot program could be to use a recently developed new type of parallel kinematic robot structure with large work space in relation to the robot foot print. For further efficient use of robots, the scenario of adaptive robot performance is introduced. This means that the robot control is optimised with respect to the thermal and fatigue load on the robot for the specific program that the robot performs. The main conclusion of the presentation is that industrial robot development is far away from its limits and that a lot of research and development is needed to obtain a more widely use of robot automation in industry.}
