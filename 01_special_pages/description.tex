% Aufgabenstellung von Betreuer...
Robot driven manufacturing systems have greater versatility but insufficient precision compared to computerized numerical control (CNC) machine tools. In challenging processes such as milling, the quality requirements cannot be reached by a single robot. An approach to overcome such a problem is the cooperation between multiple robots through the physical coupling, making them form a closed kinematic chain that is stiffer than a single serial manipulator. The goal of this thesis is the planning of stiffness enhancing actions for physically coupled robots, so that the closed-chain stiffness can be evenly improved along the whole manufacturing process and the load can be distributed according to the strength of individual robots. In this way, the quality of robot-driven manufacturing can be improved.
